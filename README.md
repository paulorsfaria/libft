# Libft

Welcome to `libft` â€“ my personalized C library! This library contains a collection of carefully crafted functions that aim to simplify and enhance the C programming experience. Developed as a part of my journey through 42-Porto, this library serves as a foundational toolkit for various projects and assignments.

## About

The `libft` project focuses on providing a robust set of functions covering fundamental operations, data structures, and utilities commonly used in C programming. Every function has been meticulously designed, following strict guidelines and norms, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.


## Usage

Feel free to explore the functions included in this library. To get started, simply clone the repository and compile the library using the provided Makefile.

## Folder Structure

The organization of directories and files in this project draws inspiration from [mlanca-c](https://github.com/mlanca-c). Their approach greatly influenced the layout and structure you see here. This folder organization was chosen for its clarity, ease of navigation, and logical arrangement, providing a framework that enhances the maintainability and readability of the codebase.
